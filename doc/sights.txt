    "longDescription": "The Red Star Line Museum does not have a typical museum collection. Do not expect endless rows of glass cabinets full of 19th-century trinkets or ship’s parts. No, the Red Star Line Museum has a very unusual collection. Above all, it collects and archives stories. Audiovisual testimonies and written documents. The museum is still looking for stories from the period between 1873 and 1935.  Of course, you will also find art in its more traditional form. For example, the Red Star Line and Antwerp, as a migration hub, inspired artists like Eugeen Van Mieghem and Louis van Engelen. What makes this museum even more special is the fact that it adopts a very modern approach in the original Red Star Line buildings. The port warehouses that were used for passengers’ administrative and medical checks are the very highlight of the collection. The Red Star Line Museum is not just a museum. The observation tower that rises above the warehouses, in the shape of a ship's smokestack, affords an amazing panoramic view. And you can visit The Shed, a cozy café and nice museum shop, up to an hour after the museum closes. Be touched by the testimonies of people who have boarded the Red Star Line - for pleasure, for business or in the hope to find a better life - and enjoy a unique view of the Scheldt and the centre of Antwerp. And sit down and talk about it afterwards in The Shed. After a visit to the Red Star Line Museum, it is definitely worth walking through the trendy Eilandje and enjoy a meal at one of the many restaurants located nearby. From Eilandje, you can also see the Port House, famously designed by the world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid Architects.",

    "longDescription": "Antwerp is the city on the Scheldt, the city on the river, facilitating encounters and exchanges between people from all over the world for several centuries. The MAS museum collects proof of these encounters, using this to tell new stories. About the city, the river and the port on the one hand. But also about the world. The MAS has many facets, and is teeming with stories and surprises. The MAS has a phenomenally large collection, which to date comprises about 500,000 items, including artworks and utensils. New objects are constantly being added to the collection. The museum uses its entire collection to weave a new narrative, based on five universal themes, on just as many floors. The MAS takes a closer look at power politics and world ports. At how food shaped and will shape today’s metropolises in the past, present and future. And at life and death, of people and gods, in the upper and under world. Moreover, the third floor and the walking boulevard host some fascinating and highly diverse temporary exhibitions. But above all, the MAS excels at connecting all these stories. This is not your typical museum, where you walk from display case to display case. Instead all the stories engage with each other, thanks to the way in which the floors have been arranged and are connected with each other. Ensuring you understand Antwerp and the world a bit better at the end of your visit.",

    "longDescription": "Beguines were devout women who lived in a community, without taking religious vows. As a consequence of this particular religious life they were neither laywomen nor nuns. The first beguinage in Antwerp (1240-1542), Het Hof Sion, was situated to the south of the city, rather far outside the city walls. After the destruction of Het Hof Sion the beguines acquired land within the city walls, where they rebuilt their beguinage in 1545. Despite a difficult period under French and Dutch rule at the end of the eighteenth century and in the early nineteenth century beguines lived here well into the twentieth century. The last Antwerp beguine, Virginia Laeremans, died in 1986. Today the beguinage has a residential function. Initially the houses were built around a square, but as a result of the growing number of beguines an alley was added. The original character and tranquillity of the beguinage have been preserved. The original church was destroyed in 1799; it was replaced by the current St. Catherine's Church in 1827.",

It is located along the Scheldt River, near a former peninsula called De Werf. The first settlement with earth walls appeared on De Werf in the 9th century. It became a fortress. Around the turn of the century, between the 12th and 13th centuries, a stone fortress wall and Het Steen, one of three gatehouses in the fortress, were constructed here. Het Steen was substantially refurbished under Charles V at the beginning of the 16th century. You can still see the colour difference in the façade. Het Steen was used as a prison until 1823. After serving shortly as a residence, sawmill and fish depot, Het Steen opened as a museum in 1862. Initially it was the Museum of Antiquities and from 1952 to 2008 it served as the National Maritime Museum. Now you can admire that collection in the MAS | Museum aan de Stroom.  Het Steen will undergo a substantial renovation starting in 2018. Het Steen will be the gateway to Antwerp in 2020 and serve as a cruise terminal, welcome centre and interactive experience route.

The municipal authorities wished to replace Antwerp's small medieval town hall with a more imposing structure befitting the prosperity of the great port city. Antwerp architect Domien de Waghemakere drafted a plan (c. 1540) for a new building in a style typical of the monumental Gothic town halls of Flanders and Brabant. But the threat of war prevented any progress on the project. The building materials intended for the Stadhuis were instead used to shore up the city defenses. Not until about 1560 new plans were developed. In the meantime Gothic architecture had gone out of fashion. The new designs for the Stadhuis were in the new Renaissance style. Completed in 1565, the building lasted hardly a decade before being burnt to a shell in the Spanish Fury of 1576. It was restored three years later.",

Like so many other European cities Antwerp also has a sanctuary for St. James. In the early fifteenth century there was a hospice here, which welcomed Northern European pilgrims travelling to the tomb of the apostle James in Santiago de Compostela. In 1413 a chapel, dedicated to St. James, was added to the hospice. Soon the chapel proved too small. As a consequence construction started on the current church in Brabant Gothic style in 1491. It would take no less than 175 years to complete the church. St. James’s Church served as parish church for several smaller crafts and guilds and religious brotherhoods. The choir was completed during the Baroque period with the tombs and chapels of wealthy families. The most famous memorial chapel is that of the Antwerp Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens. He painted the altarpiece Madonna Surrounded by Saints in the chapel. Elsewhere in the church you can admire a masterpiece by Jacob Jordaens. ",

In 1873 schreef de stad een ontwerpwedstrijd uit voor een herdenkingsmonument gewijd aan de vrijmaking van de Schelde in 1863. Deze gebeurtenis had de handel in Antwerpen sterk aangewakkerd en is een centraal thema in straatnamen en monumenten op het Zuid. Alle straten rondom het Marnixplein werden eveneens naar de vrijmaking van de Schelde genoemd. Uit de twaalf inzendingen, koos de jury het ontwerp van Winders. Het was de bedoeling dat het monument een jaar later werd ingehuldigd; technische problemen verschoven de afwerking naar 1883. In 1884 werd een smeedijzeren hek rond het monument geplaatst, uitgevoerd door Leopold van Suetendael naar ontwerp van Winders. Het werd een monumentale blikvanger, die midden op de Marnixplaats werd opgericht en vanuit alle omringende straten, tot aan de Schelde, zichtbaar is. J.J. Winders koos voor het monument een zeer fantasierijke eclectische stijl met neo-Vlaamse renaissance-elementen. Winders trachtte deze laatste stijl te promoten als de enige echte stijl die de eigenheid van België kon vertegenwoordigen. In een wijk als het Zuid, waar de neoclassicistische, verregaand gestandaardiseerde burgerhuizen in de absolute meerderheid zijn, springt de architectenwoning van Winders sterk in het oog door de exuberante gevel in neo-Vlaamse renaissance. Het was de wens van Winders om ook de architectuur die het monument Schelde Vrij zou omringen, in een passende stijl te ontwerpen. Hij tekende ontwerpen met zeer fantasierijke neo-Vlaamse renaissancegevels. Omdat hij zelf niet in staat was de nodige percelen op de Marnixplaats aan te kopen, en de Compagnie du Sud d’Anvers, hier blijkbaar ook geen prioriteit aan gaf, kreeg een plein een totaal ander, veel klassieker uitzicht dan Winders had gedroomd.",
